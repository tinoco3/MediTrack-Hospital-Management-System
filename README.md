  - Room assignments  
  - Medication administrations  
  - Physician instructions  

### Patient Records
- **Health records are mandatory** for all patients  
- Complete medical history tracking including:  
  - Diagnoses

# Database Views Documentation


  ## 1. Patient Health Summary View

```sql
CREATE VIEW Patient_Health_summary AS
SELECT 
    Patient.name, 
    diseases, 
    diagnosis_date, 
    status, 
    description
FROM Patient 
JOIN HealthRecord 
    ON Patient.patient_id = HealthRecord.patient_id;
```
Description: Combines patient name with their health conditions, status, and diagnosis details.
Discussion: Summarizes health conditions in a readable format for dashboards or reports. It enables quick access to health trends and ongoing cases. 

  ## 2. Nurse Instruction Tracking View

```sql
CREATE VIEW Nurse_Instructions AS 
SELECT 
    Nurse.name AS nurse_name,
    Instruction.instruction_id,
    InstructionExecution.status,
    InstructionExecution.execution_record,
    Instruction.description AS instruction_details
FROM Nurse
JOIN InstructionExecution 
    ON Nurse.nurse_id = InstructionExecution.nurse_id
JOIN Instruction 
    ON InstructionExecution.instruction_id = Instruction.instruction_id;
```
Description: Display each nurseâ€™s involvement in executing physician instructions, including status and execution records. 
Discussion: The reason why this is useful is that it can help evaluate the nursing staff and ensure compliance with physician orders. Also useful for audits or follow-ups.


  ## 3. Medication Administration Log

```sql
CREATE VIEW Medication_Administered AS
SELECT 
    Nurse.name AS administering_nurse,
    Medication.type AS medication_name,
    Medication.amount AS dosage,
    Patient.name AS patient_name,
    Patient.patient_id,
    Medication.date AS administration_time,
    Medication.medication_id AS record_id
FROM Medication
JOIN Nurse 
    ON Medication.nurse_id = Nurse.nurse_id
JOIN Patient 
    ON Medication.patient_id = Patient.patient_id;
```
Description: Lists which nurse administered what medication to which patient, including dates.
Discussion: The reason why this is useful is that it facilitates medication tracking, improving patient safety and ensuring proper billing and inventory control.


  ## Database Triggers

### 1. Default Room Fee Trigger

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER default_room_fee
BEFORE INSERT ON Room
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.nightly_fee IS NULL THEN
        SET NEW.nightly_fee = 800.00;
    END IF;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;
```
Description: Sets a default nightly fee of $800 if none is provided when inserting a new room.
Discussion: The reason why this trigger is useful is because it prevents incomplete data entry and enforces business rules by assigning a value for pricing. 

## 2. Room Availability Verification Trigger

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER verify_room_availability
BEFORE INSERT ON PatientRoomAssignment
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT * 
        FROM PatientRoomAssignment
        WHERE room_number = NEW.room_number 
          AND NEW.check_in <= check_out 
          AND NEW.check_out >= check_in
    ) THEN
        -- Auto-assign next available room
        SET NEW.room_number = (SELECT MAX(room_number) + 1 FROM Room);
        
        -- Create new room with default capacity and rate
        INSERT INTO Room VALUES (NEW.room_number, 2, 500.00);
    END IF;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;
```
Description: Automatically assigns a new room if the specified room is unavailable for the requested dates, and adds it to the room table. 
Discussion: The reason why this trigger is useful is that it ensures no room is double-booked and expands room inventory when needed, which enhances data integrity and availability. 

## 3. Instruction Execution Status Trigger

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER update_instructionExecution
BEFORE UPDATE ON InstructionExecution
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.execution_record = 'Done' THEN
        SET NEW.status = 'Completed';
        SET NEW.completion_time = NOW();  -- Added timestamp tracking
    END IF;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;
```
Description: If the execution_record is set to â€˜Doneâ€™, the status is automatically marked as â€˜Completedâ€™.
Discussion: The reason why this trigger is useful is that it automates status tracking and reduces human error by syncing execution records and statuses.

## Database Transactions

### Transaction 1: Complete Patient Admission

**Description**:  
Atomic operation for admitting a new patient with room assignment and initial health record creation.

**Transaction Body**:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- Patient registration
INSERT INTO Patient VALUES (6, 'Gonzalo Smith', '350 E Cermak, Chicago, IL', '773-123-4321');

-- Room assignment
INSERT INTO PatientRoomAssignment VALUES (10008, 6, 101, '2025-07-31', '2025-08-05');

-- Initial health assessment
INSERT INTO HealthRecord VALUES (1006, 6, 'High Cholesterol', '2025-07-31', 'Ongoing', 'Lifestyle changes and medication');
COMMIT;
```
Description: Insert a new patient, their room assignment, and health record, all in one operation.
Discussion: The reason why this transaction is useful is that it ensures consistency, either all patient admission data is added, or none is, preventing partial/incomplete entries. 

### Transaction 2: Patient Billing Package Creation

**Description**:  
An atomic financial operation creates an invoice with associated payable items for patient services.

**Transaction Body**:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- Invoice generation
INSERT INTO Invoice VALUES (
    7006,               -- invoice_id
    '2025-07-31',       -- issue_date
    '2025-07-27',       -- start_date
    '2025-07-30',       -- end_date
    'CHI7006',          -- account_number
    6                   -- patient_id
);

-- Line item creation
INSERT INTO Payable VALUES (
    8006,               -- payable_id
    1050.00,            -- amount
    '2025-07-31',       -- date
    'Room 101 $350x3',  -- description
    7006                -- invoice_id
);
COMMIT;
```
Description: Insert a new invoice and its corresponding payable item together.
Discussion: The reason why this transaction is useful is that it keeps financial records consistent and avoids mismatches between invoice entries and their associated charges.
